The Battle of Neighborhoods

Best place to start a Coffee Shop business


Introduction:
1.About City Toronto:
Toronto is Canada's largest city and 4th largest city in North America with a population of more than 2.9 million and a density of 4,334.4 people per square kilometer. The city is renowned as one of the most multicultural cities globally due to its large population of immigrants from all over the globe. This leads the city to become a world leader among other metropolitan and cosmopolitan cities from many sectors, including business.

2.Business Problem:
Let’s assume that some would like start Coffee Shop business in city Toronto. But they don’t know which place is better suited for them. To ensure this business success, business team requires insights into the demographics, neighbouring businesses, and crime rates. For each neighbourhood, we can ask:
* How many cafes exist?
* What are the most popular venues?
* Can we get information about the vehicle and foot traffic?
* What is the neighbourhoods’ crime rate? And so on.
Thus, the project goal is to figure out the best locations for starting-up a new coffee shop in Toronto City.
